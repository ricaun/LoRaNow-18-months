# Arduino

This code was design to work with the [LoRaNow Board V0](https://github.com/ricaun/LoRaNow-board) and [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/).

## Library

* [LMIC]
* [ArduinoUniqueID]
* [Adafruit_BMP085]

## Low Memory Available

This sheet is really big and on the current version of the [LMIC] is not possible to compile the code on the atmega328p.

## License

This library is [licensed](LICENSE) under the [MIT Licence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).
